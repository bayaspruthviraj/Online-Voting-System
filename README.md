# Online-Voting-System
The system automates vote counting, makes the process faster and
delivers results in real time once the voting window closes. With this system, costs are reduced and
voter participation will also increase as more people can participate in the process. So this is a good
solution for governments, universities and organizations who want to conduct secure, reliable
elections with transparency and trust in the system.
